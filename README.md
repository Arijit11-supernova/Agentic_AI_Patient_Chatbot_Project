# Agentic_AI_Patient_Chatbot_Project

Agentic AI Internship: Evaluation Task
This assignment is designed to evaluate your understanding of Agentic AI, multi-agent
system design, and full-stack application development. You are required to develop, host,
and present a multi-user AI chatbot using LangChain and LangGraph that simulates
patient behaviour. The chatbot must interact naturally with users, describe symptoms,
and accept prescribed treatments.	

1. Project Description:
Develop a multi-user AI chatbot application that simulates a patient interacting with
users (acting as doctors). The chatbot should describe its symptoms progressively,
answer relevant questions, and eventually accept a prescribed treatment from the user.
Your system must be built using LangChain and LangGraph, with Flask as the backend
API, and deployed on Vercel. The front-end can be built using React/JavaScript or pure
HTML/JavaScript.

2. System Requirements:
Your project should include the following components:	
• Frontend: A visually appealing interface developed in React.js or HTML/JavaScript.	
• Backend: A Flask-based API that communicates with the LangChain/LangGraph logic.	
• AI Logic: Use LangChain and LangGraph to create a conversational flow where the
chatbot simulates patient behaviour.	
• Hosting: The entire app should be deployed on Vercel.	
• Multi-user Capability: Ensure that multiple users can interact with independent
chatbot sessions simultaneously.

3. Technical Specifications:
- Use Python (Flask or FastAPI) for backend development.	
- Use LangChain and LangGraph for chatbot flow, state management, etc.	
- Frontend should consume backend APIs for chatbot communication.	
- Deploy backend on Vercel or a compatible service with Flask support.	
- Maintain session isolation for each user to ensure independent interactions.	
- Integrate minimal logging for tracking conversations (without storing sensitive data).
- 
4. Expected Deliverables:
1. Working Application: Hosted on Vercel and accessible via a public link.	
2. Source Code: Complete frontend and backend code, uploaded on ICAPP	
3. Presentation Deck: A short slide deck (max 6 slides) explaining:	
- Architecture	
- Technologies used	
- Key design choices	
- Demonstration of chatbot functionality	
4. Recorded Video Presentation: 5–7 minutes, on ICAPP, demonstrating:	
- Presentation of your deck, explaining your code and development process	
- Live chatbot demo with multiple users	
- Discussion of challenges and learnings
